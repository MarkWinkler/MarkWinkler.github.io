                As part of this part-time internship, I am responsible for requirement gathering,
                the creation and the maintenance of a website for a newly founded Academy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website is currently being built with Bootstrap and a mobile first approach.
                To find out more about the company, please see the description below.

              <p> <!-- Text from DMU LASA description, Reference [14] -->
                Within Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR) there is a need for an integrated
                collaborative multidisciplinary approach to the needs of older people, which is
                underpinned by strong evidence based focus on person-centred outcomes and experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                De Montfort University along with the two local healthcare providers (University
                Hospitals of Leicester and Leicestershire Partnership Trust) and Age UK have
                established Leicester Academy for the Study of Ageing utilising the expertise and
                resource from the individual institutions to ensure the LLR community is optimally
                equipped to meet the challenge to provide evidence based integrated care to the
                population of LLR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Academy was conceived as a holistic approach to the issues in our area concerning
                older people, covering both health and social care. We hope to approach this through
                our abilities to influence research, education and service change. The Academy aims to
                improve outcomes for older people and those that care for them, through translational,
                interdisciplinary research and educational projects that take a person-centred, whole
                system perspective. Our projects and our research will take a global perspective, but
                will seek to maximise benefits for the people of Leicester, Leicestershire &amp; Rutland.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vision of the Academy is to promote active aging, defined by the World Health
                Organisation as &ldquo;the process of optimising opportunities for health, participation
                and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age. Active ageing applies to
                both individuals and groups. It allows people to realise their potential for physical,
                social, and mental well-being throughout their lives and to participate in society
                according to their needs, desires and capacities, while providing them with adequate
                protection, security and care when they require assistance&rdquo;

                Part time work during first year of University. This role was a 16 hours part time
                job that was taken on to fund my studies. It was great to work for a large student
                accommodation that I was actually staying at. My main responsibility was being in
                charge of the online chat service, which meant that a lot of information had to be
                memorised. Taking deliveries was the other primary difficulty, which turned out to
                be a good challenge due to the very large number of tenants.
              </p>
              <p>
